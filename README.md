Afica Agility Team 4 Hackathon project
This project reflects the outcome of the hackathon, which we had to build in 48 hours.
There are a lot of gaps in between as we had limited time to properly effect the desings created by our UI/UX team members.
I have worked on the project and made changes to the html to properly link pages, stylesheets and images
I worked on the styling to ensure responsive behaviour for all pages
